For instance, given a full mix and an instrumental, we can try to recover the vocals, or given the full mix and an a cappella version, we can try to produce an instrumental version.  In the process, we can identify the precise temporal alignment between the two versions, which may be useful in its own right.</p><p>Assuming we have a full mix M and an instrumental version I, under ideal conditions we could recover the vocal line V as M - I.  However, there are very often timing offsets and small sampling rate differences (clock drift) that will defeat the simple approach.  We estimate these timing differences with short-time cross correlation (in <a href="deskew.m">deskew.m</a>), and trim and resample to correct it to within a few parts per million (milliseconds of drift over the duration of a typical track).</p><p>But even with a perfect or near-perfect time alignment, there may be differences in gain, or more generally the channel frequency response, that will still make simple subtraction inadequate. Instead, we estimate the optimal equalization filter H to minimize the energy of M - H.I.  This is done within <a href="find_in_mix.m">find_in_mix.m</a>, which calls <a href="decomp_lin_win.m">decomp_lin_win.m</a> to break the pair of signals into short chunks (e.g. 8 second chunks every 4 second), estimate the best coupling impulse response of each chunk in <a href="decomp_lin.m">decomp_lin.m</a>, then overlap-add the canceled residuals to produce the desired difference.  This actually works by estimating a whitening filter for I so that the cross-correlation of the whitened versions of M and I is simply the coupling impulse response.</p><p>This approach to cancelation is inspired by the <a href="http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/bss_eval/">BSS_EVAL</a> procedure of Fevotte, Gribonval, and Vincent.  Essentially, we are finding the difference as the "artefacts residual" when M is considered an imperfect estimate of I.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Example 1: Significant time skew and channel difference</a></li><li><a href="#2">Channel estimation for example 1</a></li><li><a href="#3">Example 2: Recovering instrumental, in stereo</a></li><li><a href="#4">Example 3: Perfectly-aligned signals, and Wiener enhancement</a></li><li><a href="#5">Example 4: Imogen Heap Instrumental Version</a></li><li><a href="#6">Command line version</a></li><li><a href="#7">Graphics display</a></li><li><a href="#8">Command-line arguments</a></li><li><a href="#9">Still to do</a></li><li><a href="#10">See also</a></li><li><a href="#11">Installation</a></li><li><a href="#12">Notes</a></li><li><a href="#13">Changelog</a></li></ul></div><h2>Example 1: Significant time skew and channel difference<a name="1"></a></h2><p>This example consists of an original instrumental track, digitized from a vinyl LP release, and a rap that uses the track as backing, taken directly from a CD.

We should put in some kind of regularization/threshold to stop this.</p><p>We don't expect the coupling filter to vary much along time, so we ought to be able to get an improvement by smoothing it along time (as in the median filtering on the Imogen Heap example). However, if there is any clock drift, we can't assume sample-level alignment of the individual impulse response estimates.  We could, however, estimate a single timing difference between each pair of impulse responses, then average them after backing that out.  For instance, we could fit a linear phase model to the phase responses of each individual coupling IR, then average their zero-phase versions, then reintroduce the individual phases (delays) to redistribute over each segment.</p><h2>See also<a name="10"></a></h2><p>This project was developed in collaboration with Colin Raffel as part of <a href="http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/hamr2013/">HAMR 2013</a>.

%% REMIXAVIER - Tools for recombining different mixes of a track
%
% 2013-06-28 Dan Ellis dpwe@ee.columbia.edu
%
% The Remixavier ("remix savior") project is concerned with recovering 
% the "difference" between different mixes of the same track.  For
% instance, given a full mix and an instrumental, we can try to
% recover the vocals, or given the full mix and an a cappella
% version, we can try to produce an instrumental version.  In the
% process, we can identify the precise temporal alignment between
% the two versions, which may be useful in its own right.
%
% Assuming we have a full mix M and an instrumental version I,
% under ideal conditions we could recover the vocal line V as M -
% I.  However, there are very often timing offsets and small sampling
% rate differences (clock drift) that will defeat the simple
% approach.  We estimate these timing differences with short-time 
% cross correlation (in <deskew.m>), and trim and resample to
% correct it to within a few parts per million (milliseconds of
% drift over the duration of a typical track).
% 
% But even with a perfect or near-perfect time alignment, there may
% be differences in gain, or more generally the channel frequency
% response, that will still make simple subtraction inadequate.
% Instead, we estimate the optimal equalization filter H to
% minimize the energy of M - H.I.  This is done within 
% <find_in_mix.m>, which calls <decomp_lin_win.m> to break the 
% pair of signals into short chunks (e.g. 8 second chunks every 4
% second), estimate the best coupling impulse response of each
% chunk in <decomp_lin.m>, then overlap-add the canceled residuals 
% to produce the desired difference.  This actually works by
% estimating a whitening filter for I so that the cross-correlation of
% the whitened versions of M and I is simply the coupling impulse
% response.  
%
% This approach to cancelation is inspired by the 
% <http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/bss_eval/ BSS_EVAL>
% procedure of Fevotte, Gribonval, and Vincent.  Essentially, we
% are finding the difference as the "artefacts residual" when M is
% considered an imperfect estimate of I.  
%% Example 1: Significant time skew and channel difference
%
% This example consists of an original instrumental track,
% digitized from a vinyl LP release, and a rap that uses the track
% as backing, taken directly from a CD.  Thus, the different signal
% paths mean that the timing is significantly different (clock
% drift of 0.1%), and the overall spectrum is very different too. 
% Load in mix and acapella as mono files
% These tracks diverge at the end (different edits), so just work
% on the first minute 
sr = 44100;
[dmix,sr] = mp3read('../Data/mc-paul-mix.mp3',[0 60*sr],1);
[dins,sr] = mp3read('../Data/mc-paul-instr.mp3',[0 60*sr],1);
% Attempt to trim and resample the full version to line up as well
% as possible with the acapella
doplot = 1;
dmr = deskew(dmix, dins, sr, 0, 1, doplot);
axis([0.5 55.5 1 1.5])
% It gets better when you repeat it
dmr = deskew(dmr, dins, sr);
% resampling can't handle ratios below 30 ppm, will just skip
% beyond that.
%% Channel estimation for example 1
% Do the short-time coupling filter estimation
tic; [resid, targ, filt, SNR, del, filts] = ...
find_in_mix(dmr,dins,sr,0.013,0.003); toc
% Listen to the residual (vocals)
% (play the second 20 seconds)
ix = 20*sr+[1:20*sr];
soundsc(resid(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_10.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
% Plot the time-local coupling filters (right channel)
% filter IR time base
tt = [1:size(filts,1)]/sr;
% times of individual short-time window (every 4 sec)
tw = 4.0*[1:size(filts,2)];
% plot
imagesc(tt,tw,filts'); axis('xy');
xlabel('time / sec')
ylabel('window time / sec')
title('local coupling filter impulse responses (cap -> mix)')
% scale down impulse response extremes
caxis([-2 2])
%% Example 2: Recovering instrumental, in stereo
%
% The Duffy track has the vocals in stereo, we can cancel left and
% right separately to good effect
[dmix,sr] = mp3read('../Data/Duffy.WarwickAvenue.mp3');
[dcap,sr] = mp3read('../Data/duffy_-_warwick_avenue_acapella.mp3');
% Deskew will process stereo files.  Skew is estimated from an
% internally-generated mono mix
dmr = deskew(dmix, dcap, sr);
dmr = deskew(dmr, dcap, sr);
clear resid targ
for i = 1:size(dmr,2)
tic; [resid(:,i), targ(:,i), filt, SNR, del, filts] = ...
find_in_mix(dmr(:,i),dcap(:,i),sr,0.006,0.003); toc
end
soundsc(resid(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_11.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
%% Example 3: Perfectly-aligned signals, and Wiener enhancement
% Message In A Bottle is an ideal case - plain subtraction of mix
% and instrumental yeilds clean vocals.  But how does estimation do?
% Load tracks as mono
sr = 44100;
dmix = mean(wavread('../Data/message-in-a-bottle-mix.wav'),2);
dins = mean(wavread('../Data/message-in-a-bottle-ins.wav'),2);
% They shoyld be perfectly aligned already, but run deskew just in case
dmr = deskew(dmix, dins, sr);
tic; [resid, targ, filt, SNR, del, filts] = ...
find_in_mix(dmr,dins,sr,0.013,0.003); toc
soundsc(resid(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_12.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
% We can apply a "wiener filter" (scaling of spectrogram magnitude
% cells) to further reduce residual artifacts.  In particular, we
% can suppress cells where the energy in the estimated vocals is
% significantly lower than the energy in the instrumental line
% projected into the mix.  wienerenhace takes a threshold so that
% energy in the residual that is below -6 dB when compared to the 
% accompaniment is suppressed
reswf = wienerenhance(resid, targ, -6.0);
soundsc(reswf(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_13.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
% We can measure SNR by canceling against the true vocals, which
% are simply the difference of dmix and dins (for this perfect example)
dvox = dmix - dins;
soundsc(dvox(ix,:), sr);  % Yes, sounds clean <A HREF="demo_remixavier_14.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
[r2, t2, f2, S2, d2, fs2] = find_in_mix(resid,dvox,sr,0.010,0.003); 
%Delay = 0.000000 s
%SNR = 19.9197 dB  <REPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASH this is our estimate of SDR
[r2, t2, f2, S2, d2, fs2] = find_in_mix(reswf,dvox,sr,0.010,0.003);
%Delay = 0.000000 s
%SNR = 16.1096 dB
% Wiener filtering introduces more artifact energy than it removes
% interference.
%% Example 4: Imogen Heap Instrumental Version
%
% This album was released with two versions of every track - a full
% mix, and an instrumental version.  Since they are derived from
% the same digital masters, there is no clock drift, although they
% are not perfectly aligned in time.  However, because each short
% segment reflects the same timing alignment, we can average the
% estimated coupling filters to further stabilize the estimation.
% Because there are a few outlier frames (degenerate estimates from
% when the vocal track is near silent), we combine across filters
% with a median instead of a mean.
[dmix,sr] = audioread('../Data/10-Aha_.m4a');
[dins,sr] = audioread('../Data/23-Aha_Instrumental_Version_.m4a');
% Deskew once just to remove any gross timing offset
dmr = deskew(dmix, dins, sr);
clear resid targ filts
% Align each channel, and store all the individual filters
for i = 1:size(dmr,2)
tic; [resid(:,i), targ(:,i), filt, SNR, del, filts{i}] = ...
find_in_mix(dmr(:,i),dins(:,i),sr,0.006,0.003); toc
end
soundsc(resid(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_15.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
% but form a grand average filter for each side
f1 = median(filts{1}');
f2 = median(filts{2}');
% The estimated filter has a pre-echo, so trim that from the convolution
[vv,xx] = max(abs(f1));
% xx is the index of the peak on the impulse response
% .. then re-filter each side with this median average impulse response
dinsf = [conv(f1,dins((xx+1):end,1)),conv(f2,dins((xx+1):end,2))];
% .. which we can subtract out
ll = min(length(dmr),length(dinsf));
dvx = dmr(1:ll,:) - dinsf(1:ll,:);
soundsc(dvx(ix,:),sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_16.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
% You can do OK with wiener enhancement even without cancelation
fftlen = 2048;
[mixwf,M] = wienerenhance(dmr, dins, 12.0, 2.0, fftlen);
ff = [0:fftlen/2]*sr/fftlen;
tt = [1:size(M,2)]*fftlen/4/sr;
imagesc(tt,ff,M(:,:,1)); axis xy  % the spectrogram mask
xlabel('Time'); ylabel('Frequency');
axis([20 40 0 4000])
soundsc(mixwf(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_17.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
% but it sounds better based on the enhanced version
[reswf,M] = wienerenhance(resid, targ, 12.0, 2.0);
soundsc(reswf(ix,:), sr); <A HREF="demo_remixavier_18.wav"><IMG SRC="sound.png" ALT="[sound]" ALIGN="middle"></A>
%% Command line version
%
% remixavier.m wraps these processes into a single function,
% suitable for turning into a compiled Matlab command-line binary:
remixavier -mix ../Data/mc-paul-mix.mp3 -part ../Data/mc-paul-instr.mp3 -out tmp.wav -dur 60 -wiener_thresh 3.0 -gain 0.9
%% Graphics display
%
% The -do_plot option provides for various visualizations: -do_plot
% 1 plots the initial cross-correlation alignment (similar to
% skewview); -do_plot 2 plots each of the short-time cancellation
% filter impulse responses, and -do_plot 3 shows aligned
% spectrograms of the mixture, the equalized part, and the
% residual:
remixavier -mix ../Data/mc-paul-mix.mp3 -part ../Data/mc-paul-instr.mp3 -dur 60 -wiener_thresh 3.0 -do_plot 3
%% Command-line arguments
%
% Invoke with -help to see all the command-line options:
remixavier -help
%% Still to do
%
% When the partial signal has very low energy, the coupling
% estimation goes crazy trying to boost it up to get rid of some of
% the energy.  We should put in some kind of
% regularization/threshold to stop this.
%
% We don't expect the coupling filter to vary much along time, so
% we ought to be able to get an improvement by smoothing it along
% time (as in the median filtering on the Imogen Heap example).
% However, if there is any clock drift, we can't assume
% sample-level alignment of the individual impulse response
% estimates.  We could, however, estimate a single timing
% difference between each pair of impulse responses, then average
% them after backing that out.  For instance, we could fit a linear
% phase model to the phase responses of each individual coupling
% IR, then average their zero-phase versions, then reintroduce the
% individual phases (delays) to redistribute over each segment.

%% Notes
%
% The included function <audioread.m audioread> is able to read a
% wide range of sound file types, but relies on a number of other
% packages and/or support functions being installed.  Most obscure
% of these is  ReadSound, a MEX wrapper I wrote for the dpwelib
% sound file interface.  See the 
% <http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/audioread/ audioread homepage>
% for more details.
